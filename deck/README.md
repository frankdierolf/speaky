## Key Messages

- **Problem**: Web3 interfaces are intimidating and complex
- **Solution**: Natural voice commands for blockchain operations
- **Vision**: "Siri for Web3" with holographic assistants
- **Progress**: Phase 2 of 4 development roadmap
- **Innovation**: First voice-controlled Ethereum wallet

## Development Phases

- **Phase 1**: âœ… Basic voice chat (Complete)
- **Phase 2**: ðŸ”„ Wallet interaction (90% - missing ENS)
- **Phase 3**: ðŸ”œ 3D character with voice
- **Phase 4**: ðŸ”œ WebAR - bring it out of the browser

## Technology Highlights

- **OpenAI Realtime API** for natural language processing
- **WebRTC** for real-time voice streaming
- **Ethers.js** for Ethereum blockchain integration
- **Nuxt 4** for modern web development
- **Future**: Three.js + WebXR for 3D/AR experiences
